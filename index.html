                <p><span>Book bans are
                rising at record pace in America, and <a
                href="https://pen.org/banned-in-the-usa/"><span >Texas has
                led the nation</span></a> in pulling books from school shelves. While
                challenges to library books and curriculum are regular occurrences for school
                officials, this unprecedented wave of censorship has brought upon challenges to
                <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/by-the-numbers"><span
                >2,571 unique titles</span></a> in 2022 alone. This
                movement to censor remains strong this year, and it's not merely about the
                books. Recent censorship, especially in states like Texas, is a symptom of a
                larger problem for the nation: the erosion of an educated, strong democracy.
                Understanding the underlying roots of book bans requires looking back to
                pivotal moments of opposition to the Civil Rights Movement with a movement to
                privatize schools in Texas.</span></p>
                
                <p><span>In the Texas
                educational landscape, the concept of school vouchers can be traced <a
                href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/texas-almost-approved-a-school-voucher-program-in-the-1950s-to-avoid-desegregation/"><span
                >as far back as 1957</span></a> with a neo-Confederate
                attempt to pass a bill offering grants to students withdrawing or refusing to
                attend schools that integrated after <i>Brown
                v. Board</i> (1954). The bill states
                it “<a href="https://lrl.texas.gov/LASDOCS/55R/HB235/HB235_55R.pdf#page=10"><span
                >will provide a means for fair choice of school</span></a>”
                and clarifies that “each person in this State has the right to avoid forced
                integration.” Seeking to reinforce financial power dynamics, the legislation
                relieved families with state funding that would “otherwise be paid to the
                district of residence.”</span></p>
                
                <p><span>“School choice”
                is a clever term. Nearly every legislative session since 1999, Texas lawmakers
                proposed school voucher bills &ndash; including <a
                href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/12/04/school-voucher-house-vote-reaction/"><span
                >three failed attempts</span></a> this year. The proposal
                is to essentially establish a state-sponsored tuition assistance program for
                K-12 private or religious schooling, which are not required to follow state
                achievement standards or nondiscrimination protections. Many stakeholders, including
                educators, students, and families, fear vouchers would only <a

                <p><span>Vouchers have
                taken shape in various proposals and have gone by many names over the years,
                from “<a

                >education savings account</span></a>” in most recent
                attempts. In fact, lawmakers have come to strictly avoid using the word
                “vouchers” in policy language to fend off criticism and reframe the proposal,
                notably since Rep. Richard Raymond began filing legislation for a <a

                ever before. Many candidates ran on campaign platforms promising to center

                school vouchers, all 15 bills in the regular session met similar fates, once
                again. In decades of state history, Texas lawmakers have, in pity to voucher
                proponents, only prevailed in amending the state's biennial budget to <a

                clearly understand their intentions and its lucrative outcome as a handshake

                <p><span>The issue censors

                victory for leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, breaking barriers for voters
                of color to participate in the United States' democratic institutions. However,

                elected to positions by the entire district's electorate. Though a member's
                term could last for a few years, select positions are on the ballot each year,

                <p><span>Before casting
                doubt on why democratic elections disproportionately benefit a particular
                demographic, the answer is clear from centuries of voter suppression. More
                recently, directly preceding the concentrated movement on the frontlines of
                Texas education, the state legislature passed a “<a
                href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/elections/2023/06/12/453905/elections-bills-including-two-targeting-harris-county-set-to-become-law/"><span
                >voter suppression bill</span></a>” in September 2021 that
                specifically targeted initiatives by officials in majority-minority Harris
                County to streamline voting for often disenfranchised voters. Subsequently, the
                legislature <a

                >intensified gerrymandering</span></a> in their decennial
                redistricting process. Now, 70% of the Texas Senate is White while only 40% of
                the state population is White, according to census definitions.</span></p>

                <p><span>With an
                inaccurate representation of Texas in the state's policymaking, there's no
                obligation for political leaders to serve the interests of Texans, much less
                the state's youngest generation. However, amid the legislature's crusade to
                assert more authority over public education, the Texas House passed <a
                href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=HB2647"><span
                >H.B. 2647</span></a>. Developed by 8th grade student in
                Round Rock ISD, <a

                >Ayaan Moledina</span></a>, the bill would allow school
                districts to appoint a non-voting student trustee to serve on its school board.
                The Texas Senate, however, did not take up the proposition before its deadline,
                leaving the bill to die. Nevertheless, it was a short-lived glimpse into what
                is possible from students involved in policymaking.</span></p>
                
                <p><span>Texas House and
                Senate seats are up for reelection in November 2024, and several moderate

                seeking a renewal of their term. Others are facing primary challengers backed
                by Gov. Abbott per <a

                >his promise</span></a> to challenge any Republican who
                took a stand against his interest in vouchers, which did not deter some rural
                Republicans from remaining steadfast in their opposition. Even Democratic
                voucher opponents like Rep. Abel Herrero, who has served for nearly two
                decades, <a
                href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/07/07/abel-herrero-texas-house-retire/"><span
                >will not seek reelection</span></a>.</span></p>
                
                <p><span>The future of
                voucher legislation is unclear, but mounting efforts by lawmakers and interest
                groups to seize control of Texas education is at the forefront of the state's
                political prospect. Examining key players, movement tactics, and desired
                outcomes reveal clear trends about the various social movements in Texas and
                how everyday Texans have little voice in the decisions directly impacting the
                public. The outlook for Texas education favors the new fashion of growing
                conservatism before the state will embolden marginalized voices in public
                education.</span></p>
                
                <p><span>Congruence exists
                among the modern movement to censor, the “school choice” and “parental rights”
                movements, and continued efforts to deny equal opportunity and respect in
                societal deference from White supremacy, Christian nationalism, patriarchy, and
                heteronormativity. For as long as the finance and fear that fuels extremism
                outweighs the call for a moral revival, students' only voice in decisions
                affecting their futures may rely on their privilege.</span></p>
